# SIMPLE_BANKING_SYSTEM_PROJECT
CREATE A SIMPLE BANKING SYSTEM PROJECT USING PYTHON

Project Definition:

In this project, we have to design a software for Banking System using Python which manages all
the basic functions like creating a new account, view account holders record, withdraws and deposit
amount, balance inquiry, and so on which can be identified from the figure below.

In this mini-project, there is no login system,so it is very easy to use all those available features without
any restriction.


Project Description:

Talking about the features of this software,
1. A user can create an account by providing an initial amount to deposit.
2. Then the user can also deposit and withdraw money just by providing the user account name ,pin
number and entering the amount.
3. Also, the user can check for the customers and their balance. This simple console-based system
provides the simplest management of bank account and transaction.
